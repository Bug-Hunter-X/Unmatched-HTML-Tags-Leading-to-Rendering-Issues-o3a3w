<p>The solution to this problem is simple: ensure that every opening tag has a corresponding closing tag, and that they are correctly nested. For example, the following HTML code is correctly structured:</p><pre>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre><p>However, this HTML code is incorrectly structured:</p><pre>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph
&lt;/div&gt;</pre><p>Because the paragraph tag is correctly closed, the issue is confined to the div tag.  This can cause problems, particularly with nested elements or JavaScript interactions. Always check your HTML code carefully for these errors, and use a code editor or browser developer tools to help you identify and fix them.  Many tools provide automatic highlighting of unmatched tags.</p>
