# Unmatched HTML Tags

This repository demonstrates a common HTML error: unmatched or unclosed tags.  Unclosed tags can lead to unexpected layout and behavior, often causing problems with form submissions, styling, and overall page rendering.  The `bug.html` file shows an example of this error; the `solution.html` file provides the corrected version.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
2. Observe the unexpected rendering issues, such as elements appearing in the wrong place, or broken form functionality.

## Solution

The `solution.html` file demonstrates the corrected code.  Always ensure that every opening tag has a corresponding closing tag in the correct order.
