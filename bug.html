<p>This is a common error that can occur in HTML. It happens when you have an unmatched opening or closing tag. For example, if you have a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag but no closing <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> tag, the browser will not know how to render the content between the opening tag and the end of the HTML file. This will cause unexpected behavior, and it will often lead to errors in other areas of the webpage.</p><p>Another example is an unclosed form.  If you have a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag but no closing <code>&lt;/form&gt;</code> tag, form submission may not function correctly. This will prevent the user from sending data to the server.</p>
